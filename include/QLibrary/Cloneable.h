/*
static_cast<const Derived&>(*this) safely downcasts the current object from Cloneable<Base, Derived> to Derived 
because CRTP guarantees that this is safe (you control both base and derived).

new Derived(*this) won't work because *this has type const Cloneable<Base, Derived>& and
Derived has no constructor taking a Cloneable<Base, Derived>, so you'd get a compiler error â€” unless you cast it properly.
